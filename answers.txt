Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Round Robin


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:


Exercise 4: both 4A and 4B

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?


Exercise 5: Process 4. It is the first number that is missing from the usual 1234 round robin pattern.


(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)

Extra credit exercises:
I did Exercise 8. I originally implemented synchronization using the atomic functions of x86sync.h. Another implementation for synchronization that I implemented was a system call, sys_print(), that prints a character to console. This can be toggled on by commenting out `#define LOCK` in schedos-1.c.
